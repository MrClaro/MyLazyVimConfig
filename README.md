# MY LAZY VIM CONFIG

Voce precisa inicialmente install:
* Lazyvim
* Tmux and tpm
* Nvim
* LazyVim

To be able to apply my configuration, you initially need to clone the official lazyvim repository

> git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
> 
> cd nvim

After that, just overwrite the .config files with those in my .config folder, and overlay the .tmux folder

> I was too lazy to finish teaching you how to configure
