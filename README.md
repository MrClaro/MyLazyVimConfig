# MY LAZY VIM CONFIG

Voce precisa inicialmente install:
* Lazyvim
* Tmux and tpm
* Nvim
* LazyVim

I recommend you install - bat exa procs dust tokei ytop tealdeer grex rmesg zoxide delta

But you will only need bat exa and zoxide to apply my .zshrc configuration

To be able to apply my configuration, you initially need to clone the official lazyvim repository

> git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
> 
> cd nvim

After that, just overwrite the .config files with those in my .config folder, and overlay the .tmux folder

> I was too lazy to finish teaching you how to configure
